While it makes our lives simpler, it is wrong to assume that projectiles only experience the force of gravity - air resistance can play a significant role in many cases. Air resistance is responsible for lower projectile speeds and distances but it is also critical to helping airplanes slow down, keeping race cars grounded at high speeds (which is why they have spoilers), and causing crazy phenomena like the Magnus effect shown below.

    "There's a fair bit going on in that last line of code that should be noted. First, by using `plt.plot` we're calling a function from `matplotlib.pyplot` (that we called `plt`) called `plot`. This function, unsurprisingly, is used to tell Python what to plot. We then pass this function a number of arguments (AKA inputs). The first argument `theta` is the list of numbers we generated earlier. The second argument `2 / g * (v_i**2) * np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta)) * np.cos(np.deg2rad(theta))` is the mathematical function we're going to plot. Here `theta` is the variable we're going to plot, and also the list of points that we generated earlier. The `**` is the Python way of saying \"to the power of\". Because `sin` and `cos` functions take radians as an input and not degrees, we use `np.deg2rad` which is a function that converts degrees to radians. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we're really saying here is \"plot $ \\frac{2}{g}v_i^2 \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)  $ for 100 $\\theta$ values between 0 and 90\".\n",

    "where the `plt.` calls are still calling functions from `matplotlib.pyplot` however this time we're creating x axes labels with `plt.xlabel` and y axes labels with `plt.ylabel`. `plt.margins(0)` removes any unnecessary blank space around the graph and `plt.grid()` adds a nice grid to visually locate points on the graph easier. Finally, `plt.title` adds a title bar to our graph. The dollar signs and \"r\" characters are just there to make the lettering look nice. Play around with the code and see if you can change the title bar, label font sizes, and margins.  <br>\n",

    "Based on the plot above, we see that the maximum range lines up with a launch angle of 45&deg; . Was this your initial guess?  \n",
    "\n",
    "With no air resistance, 45&deg; is the optimal angle because it provides the best compromise between horizontal speed and height. If you shoot it below 45&deg;, you'll get a faster horizontal velocity but the ball will also hit the ground quicker because there's less flight time. If you shoot it above 45&deg;, you'll get more flight time but a slower horizontal velocity. 45&deg; is the sweet spot between extremes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the graphical solution takes the shape of a parabola, this also demonstrates an important symmetry in the launch angles. Launch angles that are equidistant from the maximum of 45&deg; will have the same range. That is, 30&deg; and 60&deg; have the same range, 15&deg; and 75&deg; have the same range, etc. The wonders of physics!"

    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated the basics of projectile motion that can be used to determine flight paths, speeds, and times. Reasoning for why projectile motion is foundational to physics is explained, followed by a breakdown describing the horizontal and vertical components of projectile motion. The two components were brought together in an angled launch example with an interactive graph and the final question utilized Python programming to solve a basic calculus problem. Applying the skills taught in this notebook to your practice examples will give you a strong grasp of projectile motion analysis and enable __you__ to begin designing your own basic launchers!\n",
