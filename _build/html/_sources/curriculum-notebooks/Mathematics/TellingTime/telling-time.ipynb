    "When thinking of the different times of the day one thing stands out: there are two of each hour in the day; for example, 2 AM and 2 PM. Why is that?\n",

    "This dates back to the Roman times. It was decided a day should be split up into two parts, one part for day time and the other for night time.\n",

    "Initially to do this split the Romans decided to break the day up into two 12 hour blocks. As we can imagine from back in those days it would only be logical to make the 12 hours in the \"day\" start at sunrise and the 12 hours of the \"night\" start at dusk. But since the day/night cycle changes over the year (shorter days in winter for example), this caused problems.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually it was decided to change from sunset/dusk to midnight/midday, this is where AM and PM where born. AM means \"ante meridiem\" which stands for \"before midday\" and PM means \"post meridiem\" meaning, you guessed it, \"after midday\". When you think about it this makes sense: 3PM is 3 hours past the midday. Eventually it was decided that keeping one day split up into 24 hours instead of two blocks of 12 hours made more sense. The 24 hour clock was then introduced. The hours on this clock range from 0 to 23 (totalling 24 hours). We in North America still frequently use the AM/PM 12 hour day format but many parts of the world use the 24 hour clock."

For these ancient civilizations, as for us, knowing the time and months of the year was crucial to their survival. It turns out the most important clocks of all where not found on earth but in the sky! The stars and sun have been used to measure time for thousands of years and by many civilizations. Using the position of the sun casting shadows was used during the day and the position of known constellations were used at night. \n",

This makes sense, as 1 one hour is made up of 60 minutes and 1 minute is made up of 60 seconds. In everyday life we know a clock only ever goes forward, and some might say it moves relatively slow. This can make it hard to fully understand its pattern. This example breaks these rules and allows you to manipulate the clock forward and backwards, fast or slow. \n",

    "What have you noticed about the relationships between the hands as you slide back and forth? \n",

    "1. In order for the minute hand (blue) to move one full tick the seconds hand (red) must do one full rotation\n",
    "2. When the minute hand does a full rotation the hour hand will have moved 5 ticks\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the hour hand move 5 ticks per minute rotation? That is because a day has 24 hours, not 60 hours. Remember earlier when we talked about AM and PM, the 24 hour day was broken down into two 12 hour sections. So we can see that if we divide a full rotation (60 minutes) into 12 hours we get $$60\\div12=5$$ This means in the time the minute hand does a full rotation, meaning 60 minutes, the hour hand will advance 5 ticks on the clock. You will see this happening if you slide the slider from the far left all the way to the far right, the minute hand will have done a full rotation and the hour hand will have moved 5 ticks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a better understanding of the relationships between the units, can we figure out how many seconds are in 1 hour? Sure we can! Let's think about this. In 1 hour the minute hand goes around 60 times and for each one of these minutes the seconds hand goes around 60 times, this must mean $$60_\\frac{min}{hr} \\times60_\\frac{sec}{min}=3600_\\frac{sec}{hr}$$ So 1 hour has 3600 seconds. This means if you use your keyboard arrows on the slider from left to right you will need to push it 3600 times!! (Don't do that.)\n",

    "## Measuring Time\n",
    "So as we all know being able to tell the time is a crucial part of our everyday lives. It helps us know when we have appointments, when we should eat or when we should go to sleep. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time also has many other great uses like keeping time for a hockey game or measuring how long it takes to drive from one city to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take travelling from city to another as an example. Say you are going from Calgary to Edmonton and you want to calculate how long the trip takes. The simplest way of doing this without extra tools is to write down the time when you leave and then check the time when you arrive. Now all we do is take the difference between these two times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you leave at 1:32 and arrive at 4:47. You can probably estimate in your head that the trip took a little over 3 hours, but we can calculate it exactly. To make this simpler we will convert the format from hours:minutes to just have minutes. Let's recall how many minutes are in 1 hour to get the following: \n",
    "$$(1_{hr}\\times60_\\frac{min}{hr})+32_{min}=60_{min} + 32_{min}=92_{min}$$ \n",
    "$$(4_{hr}\\times60_\\frac{min}{hr})+47_{min}=240_{min} + 47_{min}=287_{min}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice these times in minutes actually mean 92 min and 287 min past noon respectively*\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we get the difference: \n",
    "$$287_{min}-92_{min}=195_{min}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So the trip took 195 minutes to get from Calgary to Edmonton. To get it back into the hours:minutes format we need to figure out how many times $195$ can be divided by $60$. We can see that $60$ will fit $3$ times inside $195$ and we will be left with a remainder of $15$, so the trip took $3$ hours and $15$ minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so that wasn't too bad. It took some work to get an exact value but it is definitely doable. Now let's take our hockey example and look at how we could keep track of the time for the game. A few things to consider before attempting this \n",
    "1. The time goes backwards from 20 minutes down to 0 milliseconds\n",
    "2. The time has to stop every time the whistle is blown\n",
    "3. The time has to be accurate to the 100th millisecond\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing this problem we can quickly see that if all we have is a regular clock then a hockey game would take a very long time between each whistle blown as someone would have to calculate the differences in time between each stop and start. Thankfully we have many different types of tools to measure times like this. In this case a scoreboard with a timeclock built in does the trick. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now all the time keeper has to do is stop and start time as the whistle is blown and the play starts again."

Laser sensors are far more accurate then the human hand-to-eye coordination. \n",
