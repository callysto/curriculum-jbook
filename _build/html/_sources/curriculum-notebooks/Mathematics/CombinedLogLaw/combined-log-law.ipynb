    "\n",
    "### Mathematical proof\n",
    "Let's create a proof of the Quotient law.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, fix quantities $x$ and $y$ and define the values \n",

    "which completes the proof of the Quotient Law.\n",

    "### Graphical Demonstration\n",
    "As we know, the Quotient Law states: $\\log_{B}x+\\log_{B}y = \\log_{B}(x \\times y).$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To go about this, we introduce a parameter $t$ that allows us to trace the graph of the logarithm function. We will also introduce two constant integers, $m$ and $n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We let $x=mt$ and $y=nt$ and set the base $B$ to 10, abbreviating $\\log_{10}(x)$ as $\\log(x)$.\n",

    "For these values of $x$ and $y$, the product law becomes  \n",

When looking at a $t$ value, the difference of the corresponding values of the functions on the left side of the equation should be equivalent to the function on the right side of the equation, thus providing a demonstration of the Quotient Law.\n"

    "### Result\n",
    "In the mathematical proof, we  used the relationship between logarithms and exponents as well as exponential laws in order to derive the Quotient Law. When we look at the graphical demonstration, we see that the functions on the right hand side both resemble very similar curves. On the left hand side of the law, we can see that the function remains as a constant number. We also see that the left-hand side of the law is equivalent to the difference to the two functions on the right-hand side."

    "In this case, there is one function on each the left and right hand sides of the law. For this reason 2 functions will be graphed. Since they are theoretically be equivalent to each other, we can expect that the functions will be identical on the graph. If this is seen on the graph, we can validate Power Law.\n",

    "We let $x=mt$ and set the base $B$ to 10, abbreviating $\\log{10}(x)$ as $\\log(x)$.\n",

When looking at a $t$ value, the function on the left side of the equation should be equivalent to the function on the right side of the equation, thus providing a demonstration of the power law."
