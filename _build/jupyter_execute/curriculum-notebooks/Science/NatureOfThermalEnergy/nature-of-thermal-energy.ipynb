For example, consider the picture of a forest below. Many trees come together to make up the entire forest. In the picture, these trees are comprised of many different shades of green. As we zoom in further, we see that these shades are actually just individual square pixels, each with one colour and brightness. The brightness, colour, and size of each pixel can be seen as the microscopic properties. The macroscopic properties would be the individual trees and the forest that they form. Microscopic properties can only be seen as we zoom into the image. Similarly, macroscopic properties can only be seen as we zoom out. \n",

    "In order to help you understand heat, it will be useful to think of the *Particle Model of Matter*. This model was first proposed by the Greek philosopher Democritus over 2000 years ago. He thought of being able to cut up matter, the stuff that makes up everything in the world, into smaller and smaller parts. Eventually, one would reach its basic components; the particles that make up all matter. The term particle is still used everywhere in the physical sciences. They can be simply thought of as small objects with certain properties such as size, speed, or colour. Typically they form interact together in terms of these properties, creating some macroscopic property. Using the concept of a particle has helped us model how different microscopic quantities combine to create macroscopic ones. The particle model states that:\n",

    "\n",
    "Heat transfer plays a deciding role in the changes of state of matter (Solid, Liquid or Gas). Let's break down how heat energy changes the state of matter and what these processes are called. Matter will be thought of as a collection of particles. The behaviour of these particles is determined by the state of matter in which they are in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Particles in a **solid** are tightly packed. They have very little motion other than vibrating in the location that they are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Particles in a **liquid** are able to move past one another. This is what gives liquids the property of being able to \"flow\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Particles in a **gas** can essentially move around freely, occasionally colliding into one another. This is why gases have so much free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the use of a macroscopic quantity to used to describe microscopic ones (state $\\rightarrow$ motion).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do the changes happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matter changes state due to heat energy. Think of the particles in a solid. As they gain more heat energy, the particles themselves gain more kinetic energy. More kinetic energy means they are moving faster, making them collide into one another more often. Eventually the bonds that hold the solid together cannot maintain the amount of collisions and the solid begins to break apart, into a liquid. This is known as melting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the matter has melted, the particles begin to flow, yet they still maintain a bit of their structure; they are still \"connected\". If you were to give them even more heat energy, the structure begins to fall apart, and eventually the matter becomes a gas where the particles can move around freely and disperse from one another. This process is called evaporation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main characteristics of a substance are the temperatures at which these transitions happen. These are known as the *melting point* and *boiling point* of the substance. For example, water has a melting point of 0$^{\\circ}$C and a boiling point of 100$^{\\circ}$C (STP) and these temperatures are a fundamental part of what it means to be \"water\". The acronym SATP stands for Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure, and is used as a standard ruler for experimental measurements. The melting and boiling points of water change at different pressures and therefore the pressure at which these quantities were measured must be specified as well. This allows for accurate comparisons between different experiments and laboratories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different changes that occur in matter are pictured below. Try to memorize the names of the different changes of state. Hover your mouse over each black box to see the names of them. Once you press the \"Play memory game\" button, you won't be able to see their names anymore and will have to match the numbers to the name of change of state. See how many times you can get them correct! You'll have them memorized in no time :-)"

Conduction is how a stove top heats a pan or why a hot cup feels warm on your hand. Different materials conduct heat faster or slower.

They will then exchange heat to the body of the mug via conduction. If the drink is cold then the mug will transfer heat to the contents. In each case the mug is in contact with the external environment; the air outside or your hand. The environment itself, depending on its temperature, will either transfer heat to or gain heat from the mug. Since this additional heat transfer is on going, eventually the mug and the drink inside will reach the same temperature as the outside environment.\n",

    "## 2. Convection\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat transfer via **convection** occurs due to the movement of molecules in a fluid (gas or liquid). Convection is perhaps the most intuitive method of heat transfer. Since it involves the flow of a gas or liquid from a warmer to a colder temperature within the fluid, it is easy to visualize. Convection does not occur in solid materials because the molecules that make up a solid do not have the ability to flow; this is what makes a solid a solid. Not unlike conduction, convection occurs from the flow of heat energy due a temperature difference within a fluid. The hotter fluid flows to regions where the fluid is cooler. It is the process which governs the currents in our oceans and the movement of air in our atmosphere. Our understanding of convection has helped us forecast the weather and even explain how energy is transported within the sun!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Why does the movement occur?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the particle model of matter, the fluid moves due to changes in **kinetic energy** of the particles in the fluid. The hotter regions in the fluid, the ones with more heat energy, have more \"excited\" particles that are colliding into one another more frequently. These regions are less **dense** than the colder regions. In the colder regions, the particles are colliding into one another less frequently therefore they do not spread out as much. Since there are less collisions, the particles are more concentrated in the colder region. These more dense and concentrated regions in the fluid are heavier since they have more particles in them. The cold, heavier regions will sink; allowing for the hotter regions to rise. Convection is the reason why \"heat rises\" in a room. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Examples of convective processes**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a pot filled with water on the stove, we observe convective heat transfer in the bubbles rising to the top of the pot. These are hotter, *less dense* regions rising to the surface of the liquid. When these regions reach the point the that they are less dense than the surrounding air, they will evaporate and undergo a transition of state from liquid to gas. \n",

    "- In stars, there is a zone in which energy is transported from the core of the star, where energy is produced by nuclear fusion, to the surface. This is known as the *convective zone*. Due to the complicated nature of energy transportation within stars, this process is difficult to model and the subject of ongoing research within the field of stellar astrophysics. Understanding convection has helped astrophysicists know more about our sun and other stars like it!\n",

    "\n",
    "- In the atmosphere, convection plays a major role in the creation of a thunderstorm. Clouds form as hotter air rises, carrying moisture with them. The air cools on its ascent, causing the moisture to condense. If the air is unstable enough, this process can occur for a longer time. This results in the formation of \"cumulonimbus clouds\", which are those very tall pillowy clouds that often produce thunder and lightning. Given enough moisture, instability in the air and convection (heat transfer), a thunderstorm is likely to occur. \n",

    "## 3. Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiation is our third and final form of heat transfer to discuss. Heat transfer via radiation occurs in all matter that has a temperature above absolute 0 (0 Kelvin). It occurs from a conversion of thermal energy into *electromagnetic energy*. Energy is \"radiated\" away from a body in the form of \"light\". This light varies in wavelength and is dependent on the temperature of the body; hotter objects emit radiation at shorter wavelengths that carry higher energy. For example, in a fire, you may have heard how the blue part of a fire is hotter than the red part. This is true and is due to the fact that blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, and since the wavelength is dependent on the temperature of the material emitting it, the blue portion of a fire is hotter. \n",
