    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Friction** is the name given to the force that resists the relative motion of one object as it slides against another. Most surfaces are rough and uneven. Even smooth surfaces, such as a polished mirror, can appear bumpy under a microscope. The bumps on these surfaces interlock as they rub against one another, which prevents them from sliding freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/rough_surfaces.svg\" width=\"35%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The more an object presses into a surface, the more the surface pushes back against the object. The force pushing back against the object is called the **normal force**, **$F_{n}$** and it is always perpendicular to the surface. From the image above, we can imagine that the more two objects are pressed together, the more difficult it is for the interlocking points to lift up and slide passed one another. As a consequence, the friction force increases. A relationship therefore exists between the magnitude of the friction force and that of the normal force. This relationship is expressed by the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{f}=\\mu F_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_{f}$ and $F_{n}$ are the magnitudes of the friction and normal forces respectively, and $\\mu$ is the **coefficient of friction**. Here $\\mu$ is the Greek letter $mu$.  The direction of the force of friction is parallel to the surface and opposite to the other forces acting on the object."

    "### Solving Friction Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a friction problem, it is useful to construct a free-body diagram. A **free-body diagram** is a simple graphical representation of an object and all the relevant forces acting upon it. An example of a free-body diagram is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/free_body_diagram.svg\" width=\"45%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* $F_{a}$ represents the **applied force**: the force acting in the direction of motion of the object.\n",
    "* $F_{f}$ represents the **friction force**: the force acting in the direction opposite to the motion of the object.\n",
    "* $mg$ represents the weight: the force of gravity acting on the object. Here, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration directed downwards and of magnitude $g=9.8\\:m/s^2$.\n",
    "* $F_{n}$ represents the normal force: the force perpendicular to the surface pressing up against the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "A 10 kg object is pushed across a flat horizontal surface with an applied force of 25 N. The same object is later pushed again with an applied force of 50 N. The coefficients of static and kinetic frictions are 0.40 and 0.30, respectively. Calculate the friction force ($F_{f}$) at each of the applied forces. Use the formula: $F_{f}=\\mu F_{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** *Construct a free-body diagram*. The free-body diagram shown above may be used for this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** *Calculate the known forces*: **Recall:** The weight of the object, $mg$, is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$mg = (10 \\times 9.8)\\:N = 98\\:N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no vertical acceleration on the object, the total vertical force must vanish so the magnitude of the normal force must be equal to that of the weight of the object ($F_{n} = mg$). Therefore, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{n} = mg = (10 \\times 9.8)\\:N = 98\\:N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** *Determine the maximum static friction force*: Now that the normal force is known, we can calculate the maximum static friction force using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{s}=\\mu_{s} F_{n} = (0.40 \\times 98)\\:N = 39\\:N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the object will resist up to 39 N of applied force before it begins to move. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** *Determine the friction force at 25 N*: Since the applied force of 25 N is less than the maximum static friction force, the object will remain stationary. The friction will oppose the applied force up to 25 N. Therefore, \n",

    "\n",
    "* **Friction** describes the force that resists the relative motion of an object as it slides across a surface. Friction forces are proportional to the normal force:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{f} = \\mu F_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Static friction** describes the friction force that acts between an object and the surface to prevent it from sliding. Static friction must be overcome for an object to move.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Kinetic friction** describes the friction force that acts between an object and the surface it slides upon. Kinetic friction is used when describing objects in motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Coefficients of static and kinetic friction** are determined experimentally for different materials. Once determined, these values can be tabulated and used to solve friction problems. An experimental method for determining the coefficients of static and kinetic friction was presented. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Friction problems** can be solved using free-body diagrams, the friction formula, and the tabulated values for the coefficients of friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Force diagrams** can be used to visualize the relationship between the friction force, the applied force, the normal force, and the coefficients of static and kinetic friction.\n",
